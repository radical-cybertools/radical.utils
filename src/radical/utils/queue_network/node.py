""" 
Provide an abstract base class for a component of a distributed queue network.
The node can exist either as thread, as a local process, or as a remote process,
spawned via SAGA.  The communication between nodes is always via queues, were
groups of nodes feed into the same queues, and/or are fed from the same queues.
A node can be fed from multiple queues, where queues are prioritized according
to some policy.
