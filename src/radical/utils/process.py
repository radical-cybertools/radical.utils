class Process(mp.Process):
    '''
    This `Process` class is a thin wrapper around `mp.Process` which
    specifically manages the process lifetime in a more cautious and copperative
    way than the base class: *no* attempt on signal handling is made, we expect
    to exclusively communicate between parent and child via a socket.
    A separate thread in both processes will watch that socket: if the socket
    disappears, we interpret that as the other process being terminated, and
    begin process termination, too.

    NOTE: At this point we do not implement the full `mp.Process` constructor.

    The class also implements a number of initialization and finalization
    methods which can be overloaded by any deriving class.  While this can at
    first be a confusing richness of methods to overload, it significantly
    simplifies the implementation of non-trivial child processes.  By default,
    none of the initialized and finalizers needs to be overloaded.

    An important semantic difference are the `start()` and `stop()` methods:
    both accept an optional `timeout` parameter, and both guarantee that the
    child process successfully started and completed upon return, respectively.
    If that does not happen within the given timeout, an exception is raised.
    Not that the child startup is *only* considered complete once all of its
    initialization methods have been completed -- the start timeout value must
    thus be chosen very carefully.  Note further that the *parent*
    initialization methods are also part of the `start()` invocation, and must
    also be considered when choosing the timeout value.  Parent initializers
    will only be executed once the child is known to be alive, and the parent
    can thus expect the child bootstrapping to be completed (avoiding the need
    for additional handshakes etc).  Any error in child or parent initialization
    will result in an exception, and the child will be terminated.

    Along the same lines, the parent and child finalizers are executed in the
    `stop()` method, prompting similar considerations for the `timeout` value.

    Any class which derives from this Process class *must* overload the 'work_cb()`
    method.  That method is repeatedly called by the child process' main loop,
    until:
      - an exception occurs (causing the child to fail with an error)
      - `False` is returned by `work_cb()` (causing the child to finish w/o error)

        This method MUST NOT be overloaded!

        This is the workload of the child process.  It will first call the child
        initializers and then repeatedly call `self.work_cb()`, until being
        terminated.  When terminated, it will call the child finalizers and
        exit.  Note that the child will also terminate once `work_cb()` returns
        `False`.

        The implementation of `work_cb()` needs to make sure that this process is
        not spinning idly -- if there is nothing to do in `work_cb()` at any point
        in time, the routine should at least sleep for a fraction of a second or
        something.

        Child finalizers are only guaranteed to get called on `self.stop()` --
        a hard kill via `self.terminate()` may or may not be able to trigger to
        run the child finalizers.

        The child process will automatically terminate (incl. finalizer calls)
        when the parent process dies. It is thus not possible to create daemon
        or orphaned processes -- which is an explicit purpose of this
        implementation.

        `stop()` is symmetric to `start()`, in that it can only be called by the
        parent process.  It MUST be called from the main thread.  Both
        conditions are asserted.  If a subthread or the child needs to trigger
        the termination of the parent, it should simply terminate/exit its own
        scope, and let the parent detect that via its watcher thread.  That will
        eventually cause `is_alive()` to return `False`, signalling the
        application that `stop()` should be called.

        This method sets the thread termination signal, and call `stop()` on all
        watchables.  It then calls `join()` on all watchables, with the given
        timeout, and then also joins the child process with the given timeout.

        If any of the join calls fails or times out, an exception will be
        raised.  All join's will be attempted though, to collect as many threads
        and processes as possible.


        NOTE: `stop()` implies `join()`!  Use `terminate()` if that is not
              wanted.  Terminate will not stop watchables though.

        NOTE: The given timeout is, as described above, applied multiple times,
        once for the child process, and once for each watchable.

          * `work_cb()` needs to enforce any call rate limits on its own!
          * in order to terminate the child, `work_cb()` needs to either raise an
            exception, or call `sys.exit()` (which actually also raises an
            exception).

        possible.  The latter will not always be possible if the child is
        terminated by a signal, such as when the parent process calls
        `child.terminate()` -- `child.stop()` should be used instead.

        The overloaded method MUST return `True` or `False` -- the child will
        continue to work upon `True`, and otherwise (on `False`) begin
        termination.
