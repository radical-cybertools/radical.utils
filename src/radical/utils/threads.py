class Thread(mt.Thread):
    '''
    This `Thread` class is a thin wrapper around `mt.Thread` which specifically
    manages the thread lifetime in a cautious and copperative way: *no* attempt
    on signal handling is made, no exceptions and interrupts are used, we expect
    to exclusively communicate between parent and child via a `mt.Events` and
    `Queue.Queue` instances.
   
    NOTE: At this point we do not implement the full `mt.Thread` constructor.
   
    The class also implements a number of initialization and finalization
    methods which can be overloaded by any deriving class.  While this can at
    first be a confusing richness of methods to overload, it significantly
    simplifies the implementation of non-trivial child threads.  By default,
    none of the initialized and finalizers needs to be overloaded.
   
    An important semantic difference are the `start()` and `stop()` methods:
    both accept an optional `timeout` parameter, and both guarantee that the
    child threads successfully started and completed upon return, respectively.
    If that does not happen within the given timeout, an exception is raised.
    Not that the child startup is *only* considered complete once all of its
    initialization methods have been completed -- the start timeout value must
    thus be chosen very carefully.  Note further that the *parent*
    initialization methods are also part of the `start()` invocation, and must
    also be considered when choosing the timeout value.  Parent initializers
    will only be executed once the child is known to be alive, and the parent
    can thus expect the child bootstrapping to be completed (avoiding the need
    for additional handshakes etc).  Any error in child or parent initialization
    will result in an exception, and the child will be terminated.
   
    Along the same lines, the parent and child finalizers are executed in the
    `stop()` method, prompting similar considerations for the `timeout` value.
   
    Any class which derives from this Thread class *must* overload the 'work_cb()`
    method.  That method is repeatedly called by the child thread's main loop,
    until:
      - an exception occurs (causing the child to fail with an error)
      - `False` is returned by `work_cb()` (causing the child to finish w/o error)
