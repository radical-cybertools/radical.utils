class Lockfile(object):
    '''
    This class represents a lockfile.  On calling `open()` (or entering
    a resource context `with`), the lockfile is exclusively opened and locked.
    The returned object can be used for `read()`, `write()` and `seek()`
    operations, and the lock is only released on `close()` (or when leaving the
    resource context).

    If `delete=True` is specified on construction, then the lockfile is removed
    uppon `release()`, and the content is lost.  Only for this mode is it
    possible to obtain the current lock owner when using `get_owner()` while
    waiting for a lock owned by another process or thread - the call will return
    'unknown' otherwise.

    Note that the file offset is not shared between owner of the lock file
    - a newly acquired lock on the file should prompt a seek to the desired
    file location (the initial offset is '0').

    Example:

        with ru.Lockfile(fname) as lf0:
            lf0.write('test 0\n')

        with ru.Lockfile(fname) as lf1:
            lf1.lseek(0, os.SEEK_SET)
            lf1.write('test 1\n')

        with ru.Lockfile(fname) as lf2:
            lf2.lseek(0, os.SEEK_END)
            lf2.write('test 2\n')

            # raises a RuntimeError, as we won't be able to acquire the lock
            with ru.Lockfile(fname) as lf3:
                lf3.lseek(0, os.SEEK_END)
                lf3.write('test 3\n')

        with open(fname, 'r') as fin:
            data = fin.read()
            assert(data == 'test 1\ntest 2\n')

    Example:

        lf1 = ru.Lockfile(fname)
        lf2 = ru.Lockfile(fname)

        with lf1:
            lf1.write('test 0')

            with lf2(timeout=3):
                # we won't reach this, the `with` above will time out and raise
                lf2.write('test 0')


    Implementation:

    The implementation relies on cooperative locking: a process or thread which
    uses this API to lock a file will create a temporary file in the same
    directory (filename: `.<filename>.<pid>.<counter>` where `counter` is
    a process singleton).  On lock acquisition, we will attempt to create
    a symbolic link to the file `<filename>.lck`, which will only succeed if no
    other process or thread holds that lock.  On `release`, that symbolic gets
    removed; on object destruction, the temporary file gets removed.

    The private file will contain the name of the owner.  Any other process or
    thread can follow the `.<filename>.lck` symlink, open the link's target
    file, and read the name of the owner.  No attempt is made to avoid races
    between failure to acquire the lockfile and querying the current owner, so
    that information is not reliable, but intented to be an informative help for
    debugging and tracing purposes.

    Example:
        lf1 = ru.Lockfile(fname)
        lf2 = ru.Lockfile(fname)

        with lf1:
            lf1.write('test 0')

            try:
                lf2.acquire()  # timeout == None == 0.0
            except RuntimeError:
                print('lock is held by %s' % lf2.get_owner())
