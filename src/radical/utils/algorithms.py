def collapse_ranges (ranges):

    Given be a set of ranges (as a set of pairs of floats [start, end] with
    'start <= end'.  This algorithm will then collapse that set into the
    smallest possible set of ranges which cover the same, but not more nor
    less, of the domain (floats).

    We first sort the ranges by their starting point.  We then start with the
    range with the smallest starting point [start_1, end_1], and compare to
    the next following range [start_2, end_2], where we now know that
    start_1 <= start_2.  We have now two cases:

    a) when start_2 <= end_1, then the ranges overlap, and we collapse them into
    range_1: range_1 = [start_1, max[end_1, end_2]

    b) when start_2 > end_1, then ranges don't overlap.  Importantly, none of
    the other later ranges can ever overlap range_1, because there start points
    are even larger.  So we move range_1 to the set of final ranges, and restart
    the algorithm with range_2 being the smallest one.

    Termination condition is if only one range is left -- it is also moved to
    the list of final ranges then, and that list is returned.

# Assume we want to schedule a set of tasks over a set of resources.  To
# maximize utilization, we want to place the largest tasks first and fill the
# gap with small tasks, thus we sort the list of tasks by size and schedule
# beginning with the largest.
#
# For large number of tasks this can become expensive, specifically once the set
# of resources is near exhaustion: we need to search through the whole task list
# before being able to, possibly, place some small tasks.
#
# The algorithm below attempts to use the knowledge that, once a task of
# a certain size can *not* be scheduled, no larger task can.  It performs as
# follows:
#
#       1  attempt to schedule the largest task (n)
#       2  if success
#       3      schedule the next smaller task (n = n - 1)
#       4      if success
#       5          goto (2)
#       7  bisect distance to smallest task: l = bisect(m, 0)
#       8  schedule task l
#       9  if success   # task l is small enough
#      10      bisect distance toward larger task: l = bisect(m, l)
#      11      goto 9
#      12  else         # task l is still too large
#      13      bisect distance towards smaller tasks: l = bisect(l, 0)
#      14      goto 9
#
# This algorithm stops once (m - l == 1), which is the boundary between 'too
# large' and 'small enough' tasks.  From here, we mark all tasks > m as too
# large, set n = l, and begin from scratch.
#
# The implementation below contains some further optimizations.  Specifically,
# we remember the schedule results of all bisections, so that we don't schedule
# or test those tasks twice.  Further, we assume that scheduling a task may
# alter the result for all further schedule attempts (apart from tasks we know
# are too large).
#
# Example:
#
#   # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   #
#   # Tasks larger 65 cannot be scheduled.  Once 65 is scheduled, 64 is too
#   # large and fails.  63, 62, 61 fit, but then space is tight and all tasks up
#   # to 42 fail.  42 to 22 get scheduled ok, but then space is out again for
#   # everything larger than 7 - the last 8 tasks (very small) can be scheduled.
#   #
#   # Out of the 128 tasks, 32 will get schedules, so 96 will not.  Instead of
#   # trying schedule those 96 tasks, the algorithm will only test 15 tasks
#   # unsuccessfully (~15%).  The effect improves with larger numbers of tasks
#   # and less available resources, which is usually the case when the RP
#   # scheduler sees high contention between scheduling and unscheduling
#   # operations.  For example, the same setup for 128k tasks results in 25
#   # failed scheduling attempts (0.01%).
#   #

    accept a list element for good/bad checks, and return `True` for good (small
    enough), `False` otherwise (too large).

    Note that this is only a bisect if `ratio` is set at `0.5` - otherwise the
    search will back off through the list faster (1.0 >= ratio > 0.5) or slower
    (0.5 > ratio >= 0.0) than bisect.

    raise an exception are also handled as `bad`, any element on which this
    happens will be returned in the third list (`fail`).  Note that this last
    list (`fail`) will consist of tuples: [`element`, `error`] where `error` is
    the exception's error message.

    `on_ok` will be called on tasks where `check()` returned `good`, `on_nok`
    where `check()` returned `bad`, `on_fail()` where `check()` raised an
    exceptionm and `on_skip` where bisect decided that no
    `check()` invocation is needed.  The respective data item is the only
