def collapse_ranges (ranges):

    Given be a set of ranges (as a set of pairs of floats [start, end] with
    'start <= end'.  This algorithm will then collapse that set into the
    smallest possible set of ranges which cover the same, but not more nor
    less, of the domain (floats).

    We first sort the ranges by their starting point.  We then start with the
    range with the smallest starting point [start_1, end_1], and compare to
    the next following range [start_2, end_2], where we now know that
    start_1 <= start_2.  We have now two cases:

    a) when start_2 <= end_1, then the ranges overlap, and we collapse them into
    range_1: range_1 = [start_1, max[end_1, end_2]

    b) when start_2 > end_1, then ranges don't overlap.  Importantly, none of
    the other later ranges can ever overlap range_1, because there start points
    are even larger.  So we move range_1 to the set of final ranges, and restart
    the algorithm with range_2 being the smallest one.

    Termination condition is if only one range is left -- it is also moved to
    the list of final ranges then, and that list is returned.

def range_concurrency(ranges):
    '''
    given a set of *un*collapsed ranges, return a series which describes the
    range-concurrency at any point.

    Example:
      Ranges: 
        [----]  [---------]             [--------]
          [--------]         [-]      [------------]      [--]

      Concurrency:
        1 2  1  2  1      0  1 0      1 2        1 0      1  0

    Returned is a sorted list of tuples where the first entry defines at what
    range value the concurrency changed, and the second value defines to what
    the concurrency count changed at that point.

    You could consider the ranges to be of type `[time_start, time_end]`, and
    the return would be a list of `[timestamp, concurrency]`, if that helps --
    but the algorithm does not make any assumption on the data type, really,
    only that the values can be sorted.
